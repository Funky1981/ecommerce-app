## 📝 Notes & Progress

### **Current Focus:** Navigation Component with Enterprise ITCSS + BEM Architecture

**Next Up:** Building responsive navbar with hamburger menu using SCSS mixins and breakpoints

### **Enterprise Standards Being Implemented:**

- **ITCSS Architecture:** 7-layer CSS organization for scalability
- **BEM Methodology:** Block Element Modifier naming conventions
- **Mobile-First Responsive:** Cross-browser compatible design system
- **SCSS Mixins & Variables:** Reusable code patterns and design tokens

### **Key Learning Themes:**

- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns, maintainable code structure
- **Angular Patterns:** Standalone components, services, dependency injection
- **Reactive Programming:** RxJS, Observables, state management
- **Enterprise CSS:** ITCSS, BEM, responsive design systems
- **Interview-Ready Code:** Industry best practices and professional patterns

### **Daily Reflection Questions:**

- What new Angular concept did I learn today?
- How does this fit into the Clean Architecture pattern?
- What enterprise-level practices did I implement?
- How would I explain this to an interviewer?
