## 📝 Notes & Progress

### **Current Focus:** Architecture Foundation
**Next Up:** Navigation component - Learning shared components and routing

### **Key Learning Themes:**
- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns, maintainable code structure
- **Angular Patterns:** Standalone components, services, dependency injection
- **Reactive Programming:** RxJS, Observables, state management
- **Modern Web Development:** TypeScript, responsive design, testing

### **Daily Reflection Questions:**
- What new Angular concept did I learn today?
- How does this fit into the Clean Architecture pattern?
- What would I do differently next time?
